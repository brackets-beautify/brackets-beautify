## Issues
Brackets Beautify uses [js-beautify](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify) to beautify files and is therefore limited to its capabilities.

If you have any issue concerning the formatting, please test it on the website of the library first:
```
http://jsbeautifier.org/
// This is just a sample script. Paste your real code (javascript or HTML) here.

if ('this_is'==/an_example/){of_beautifier();}else{var a=b?(c%d):e[f];}

If the issue persists, please refer to the [js-beautify issues](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify/issues).
